This project will convert an Oracle schema into an HSQLDB schema. This is useful to have a test database that is easily embeddable for regression testing, especially now that HSQLDB has an Oracle compatibility mode.

I forked this from the google code project oracle2hsqldb, which in turn was forked from the long abandoned SchemaMule project. I upgraded it to use more modern libraries. The license is the same as the original project, LGPL.
